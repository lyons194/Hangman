#This page contains the database of words that the program can potentiall use!
#The database will have two elements: An extensive list of random nouns, and a random number generator.  Depending on the parameters set with respect to the random number generated, the program will choose one of the words from the extensive list.
"""


**Note: Though the program prints the selected word, future drafts of the program will not print the word.  The word will remain a secret to the user.  Then, once the word is selected, the program will print blank spaces for each letter of the word.  Below is a rudimentary draft of this portion of the program.
